**Spousing Expanded** is a comprehensive mod for Stardew Valley that enhances the spouse experience within the popular _Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE)_ mod.
Designed to deepen your in-game relationships, this mod introduces a wealth of new content for each SVE spouse, bringing them to life like never before.

Even though _SVE_ already did a great job bringing all those new characters to life with dialog and several heart events, I wanted to ge even further beyond.
This mod aims to immensely update the marriage experience in stardew valley with spouses introduction by _SVE_.

The mod is updated step-by-step to eventually update all _SVE_ spouses. With high enough demand and time on hand, it could also be considered to update vanilla spouses as well,
but for now the focus lies on SVE characters exclusively. (The wizard is an exception, as SVE made him romanceable, so he will be included too.)
